        <p class="div__p"> Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications
            aim to cut out the middlemen  of our everyday finances.
            By Alyssa Hertig.DeFi is short for 
            “decentralized finance,” an umbrella term for a variety
            f financial applications in cryptocurrency or blockchain
            geared toward disrupting financial intermediaries.
            DeFi draws inspiration from blockchain,
            the technology behind the digital currency
            bitcoin, which allows several entities to hold
            a copy of a history of transactions, meaning
            it isn’t controlled by a single, central source.
            That’s important because centralized
            systems and human gatekeepers can limit the speed
            and sophistication of transactions while offering
            users less direct control over their money.
